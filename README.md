**Assignment1**
   
    Creation and evaluation syntax tree using Lex and YACC. 

**Assignment2**

Extending the language to support global variable declaration with variables of type "integer", assignment statements, and function calls. 
      The global variable declaration if present in the program should come first.
      The expression for calculator should be extended with assignment statements and function calls.
       
       One sample declaration statemtent block  in the source program is given below
       
             begindecl 
                 integer  var1, var2,var3;
             enddecl
       One sample asignment statement sequence is given below.
              
              var1=10;

  **Assignment 3**
  
    Extend Assignment two have  support for 
      - (a) One Dimensional Array, (b) if-then-else, (c) for loop
      - Print symbol table and AST( Abstract Syntax Tree)
